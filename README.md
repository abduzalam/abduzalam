Hello, my name is Abdul Salam. Programming for computers is something I'm interested in. I am proficient with the C#.Net,SQL Server and Oracle databases and C++ programming languages. Additionally, I occasionally use Python to write code. Web technologies are something that interest me as well. For fun, I've developed a few web applications in Asp.Net Core With EF Core , MSSQL Back-end & Deployed in Azure Portal. I also tried out web development projects using Angular and React FWs.
